-Try to get the footer to be at the bottom of the window, but then push it off-screen when scrolling is on the page - rather than just being statically at the bottom of the window all the time.

-Double check specs & requirements, and make sure everything is met.

-Organize CSS; least to most specific, from top to bottom.

-Possibly add a CSS reset file. One in my repos folder - just need to add to portfolio repo and apply it on pages.

-Clean up all code; for nodes, classes, and IDs in CSS, for instance, have consistency; all lowercase, no spaces (use hyphens instead), no underscores or other special characters.

-Look at the Contact page and see if there's a 'nicer' way to present it; better font selection, nicer boxes, etc. The submit button is a little messy looking with the border and the element outline when it's the active element on the page; maybe change the border a bit, also see if I can somehow change the element outline.

-Stuff shifts slightly to the left on pages where there is a scroll bar taking up some of the window space (contact and portfolio on smaller screens); see if this can be prevented.

-The transition on hovering over links in the title bar works just fine for the text color fade - but not for the underlining text decoration. See if the underline can also be part of the transition.

-Think if there's any other fun content to be added to the About or Portfolio screen.
