                My name is Adam. I'm a simple man - I find stuff that's fun, then do whatever I can to make sure I have time to do that stuff.<br><br>
                What kinda fun stuff? Well, a little bit of everything! It can include woodworking, reading, biking, board games, video games, making music and movies, playing darts, swimming, axe throwing, or playing with an Etch-A-Sketch. All of these things become more fun when I include other people who also like to do fun stuff. I'll try just about anything if asked.<br><br>
                I am married and have two kids and a dog. The boy is initially shy, but becomes quite boistrous when he gets comfortable around people, much like me. The girl has gumption, which can really kick me in the behind if I'm not prepared - but I otherwise love it. She gets it from her mom 'cuz that didn't come from me.
